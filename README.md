# TSEPManifestGenerator

Purpose and description
=======================

Manifest Generator is used to generate manifest.xml files that are needed for Tekla Structures Extension Packages (TSEP). You can fill all needed data and have a fully functional manifest file, or you can leave some or all fields empty and manually edit the manifest file as needed.

System requirements
===================

.NET Framework version:	4.5

Installation
============

Copy the executable and Defaults.ini file to any suitable location and run the tool separately

Instructions

Future

Some ideas for improving the tool if needed:
- highlight files over folders in the file tree
- don't show folders that don't have files matching the pattern in the file list
